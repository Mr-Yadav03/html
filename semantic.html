<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <!-- You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page.
     This is meant to assist search engines and browsers. -->
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- Meta Data
To ensure proper interpretation and correct search engine indexing, 
both the language and the character encoding <meta charset="charset"> 
should be defined as early as possible in an HTML document: -->
<!-- In HTML, it is optional to close empty elements.
Allowed:
<meta charset="utf-8">
Also Allowed:
<meta charset="utf-8" />
If you expect XML/XHTML software to access your page, keep the closing slash (/), because it is required in XML and XHTML. -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
<!-- Setting The Viewport
The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

You should include the following <meta> element in all your web pages:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
This gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag: -->
    <title>Document</title>
    <style>
        .all-browsers{ /* this is definition for all browser element*/
            margin: 0;
            padding: 5px;
            background-color: lightgray;
        }
        .all-browsers > h1, .browsers{ /* Targeting the h1 header with all browser and .browser is included as child tag here */
            margin: 10px;
            padding: 5px;
        }
        .browser{
            background: lightgreen;
        }
        .browser > h2, p{
            margin: 4px;
            font-size: 90%;
        }
        aside{
            width: 30%;
            padding-left: 15px;
            margin-left: 15px;
            float: right;
            font-style: italic;
            background-color: lightpink;
        }
    </style>

<!-- Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.
What are Semantic Elements?
A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
Semantic Elements in HTML
Many web sites contain HTML code like: <div id="nav"> <div class="header"> <div id="footer"> to indicate navigation, header, and footer.
In HTML there are some semantic elements that can be used to define different parts of a web page:  

<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time> -->

<!-- HTML <section> Element
The <section> element defines a section in a document.
According to W3C's HTML documentation: "A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading."
Examples of where a <section> element can be used:

Chapters
Introduction
News items
Contact information
A web page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information. -->
<!-- <section>
    <h1>WWF</h1>
    <p>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is an international organization working on issues regarding the conservation, 
        research and restoration of the environment, formerly named the Wordl Wildfire Fund. WWF was founded in 1961.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h1>WWF's Panda symbol</h1>
    <p>The Panda has become the symbol of WWF. The well-known panda logo of WWF originated from a panda named Chi Chi That
        was tansferred from the Beijing Zoo to the London Zoo in the same year of the establishment of WWF.</p>
</section> -->
<!-- HTML <article> Element
The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.
An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site.
Examples of where the <article> element can be used:

Forum posts
Blog posts
User comments
Product cards
Newspaper articles -->

  <!-- Nesting <article> in <section> or Vice Versa?
The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.
The <section> element defines section in a document.
Can we use the definitions to decide how to nest those elements? No, we cannot!
So, you will find HTML pages with <section> elements containing <article> elements, 
and <article> elements containing <section> elements.
HTML <header> Element
The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.
A <header> element typically contains: 
one or more heading elements (<h1> - <h6>)
logo or icon
authorship information
Note: You can have several <header> elements in one HTML document. However, <header> cannot be placed within a <footer>, 
<address> or another <header> element. -->
    <article class="browser">
        <headerc class="all">
            <h1>What does WWF do?</h1>
            <p>WWF's Mission:</p>

Notice that NOT all links of a document should be inside a <nav> element. The <nav> element is intended only for major blocks of navigation links.
