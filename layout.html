    <!-- HTML Layout Elements
HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:

HTML5 Semantic Elements	
<header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
<nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
<section> - Defines a section in a document
<article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
<aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
<footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
<details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
<summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element
You can read more about semantic elements in our HTML Semantics chapter. -->

<!-- HTML Layout Techniques
There are four different techniques to create multicolumn layouts. Each technique has its pros and cons:

CSS framework
CSS float property
CSS flexbox
CSS grid -->

<!-- CSS Float Layout
It is common to do entire web layouts using the CSS float property. 
Float is easy to learn - you just need to remember how the float and clear properties work. 
Disadvantages: Floating elements are tied to the document flow, which may harm the flexibility. 
Learn more about float in our CSS Float and Clear chapter. -->

<!-- CSS Flexbox Layout
Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate 
different screen sizes and different display devices.
Learn more about flexbox in our CSS Flexbox chapter. -->

<!-- CSS Grid Layout
The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, 
making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.
