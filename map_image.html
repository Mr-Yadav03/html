<!-- The idea behind an image map is that you should be able to perform different actions depending on where in the image you click.
    To create an image map you need an image, and some HTML code that describes the clickable areas. -->
    <!-- The usemap value starts with a hash tag # followed by the name of the image map, 
    and is used to create a relationship between the image and the image map. 
The <map> element is used to create an image map, and is linked to the image by using the required name attribute.
    The name attribute must have the same value as the <img>'s usemap attribute . 
A clickable area is defined using an <area> element.

You must define the shape of the clickable area, and you can choose one of these values:
rect - defines a rectangular region
circle - defines a circular region
poly - defines a polygonal region
default - defines the entire region
